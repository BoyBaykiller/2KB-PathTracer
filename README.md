# 2KB-PathTracer
This project is just me trying to get as much of a Path Tracer into a 2KB executable. I am taking the main shader from [an other project](https://github.com/JulianStambuk/OpenTK-PathTracer) so it's more a task of learning C, building a development environment and copy pasting Win32 API Code. Note that I am deliberately doing things like not calling `free` because of size.
